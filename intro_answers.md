<h1>Problem 1</h1>

<ul>
<li>I could sort it from Maximum to minimum or color code the lines from maximum to minimimum.  </li>
<li> a. https://marketplace-cdn.atlassian.com/files/images/org.swift.confluence.table/84d41690-2d08-41a7-88bd-87f645a7b2b9_scaled.png ; This chart has more colors which helps to differentiate between the rows more easily. b. http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oEuJ9QjDCCQ/UeBaAqRgHSI/AAAAAAAAGIM/UB5ORMvUbHA/s1600/table2.png ; This table has a high contrast between the header and the data so it makes the names of each column very clear upon first glance. c. http://simonrogersdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-10-at-6-15-43-pm.png ; This chart has a clear toggle on top of the table that allows the user to sort the data by sport and by countrty quickly and easily</li>
