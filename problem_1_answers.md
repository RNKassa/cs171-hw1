<h1>Problem 1</h1>

<ul>
<li>It makes the table header span the same width as the number of columns indicated by colspan, in this case 3. </li>
<li>HTML: align (aligns the table header text in the center of the block. CSS: padding (clears the area around the content inside the border of an element)</li>
<li>The DOM inspector collapses the tags and physically nests the tags. HTML Source Code haas it all spread out. They both have their positives. The DOM is useful for viewing the overall structure, and evaluating what tags fall beneath others. The HTML Source Code has everything listed out so it is much easier to evaluate logic and scripts you wrote.</li>
</ul>
